 <H1> Climate Change </H1>
- 👋 Hi, I’m <strong>@meghan117</strong>

- 👀 Today we will be discussing climate change and how it will affect our world in the approaching years.
- 🌱 In the past century, the effects of climate change have become relevant. The glaciers have shrunk, the ice on lakes and rivers melts considerably earlier in the year, the trees bloom earlier, and plants and animals have shifted their ranges. According to scientists, the global temperatures will continue to rise in the coming years, and the sea levels will continue to rise as the glaciers melt. Some of the effects of climate change are the sea levels rising, hurricanes becoming stronger, their will be an increase in droughts and heat waves, and the frost-free season will continue to legthen.
