 <H1> Climate Change </H1>
- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>@meghan117</strong>

- ðŸ‘€ Today we will be discussing climate change and how it will affect our world in the approaching years.
- ðŸŒ± In the past century, the effects of climate change have become relevant. The glaciers have shrunk, the ice on lakes and rivers melts considerably earlier in the year, the trees bloom earlier, and plants and animals have shifted their ranges. According to scientists, the global temperatures will continue to rise in the coming years, and the sea levels will continue to rise as the glaciers melt. Some of the effects of climate change are the sea levels rising, hurricanes becoming stronger, their will be an increase in droughts and heat waves, and the frost-free season will continue to legthen.
- Global teperatures: over the past century the temperatures worlwide, have rose about 1.8 F, and will continues to rise
- Sea levels: over the past twenty years, it has rose 3.2 mm/year, when in the twentieth century it was nearly have of that
- Glaciers: over 30 well-studied glaciers have shrunk by more than 60 feet since 1980
- Sea ice in the Arctic: the area in the Actric has shurk nearly 40% since 1979
- Carbon dioxide: the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased over 25% since 1959
